    <h1>Internet is Easy!</h1>
    <p>
        First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
        Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how we make an unordered list</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>
            We should be noticing things is in precise order, because this is an ordered list.
        </li>
    </ol>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes,</em> we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.
        <em>
            <strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong> 
        </em></p>

    <h2>Empy Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for Ready! Learning HTML should be getting easier now.</p>

        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll learn how to fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
